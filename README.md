  Import data from two source systems—**ERP** and **CRM**—provided as CSV files.

- **Data Quality:**  
  Cleanse raw data, standardize formats, and resolve quality issues before analysis.

- **Integration:**  
  Combine ERP and CRM data into a unified data model optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope:**  
  Focus on the **latest dataset only**; historization/SCD is not required.

- **Documentation:**  
  Deliver clear data model documentation for business and analytics stakeholders.
